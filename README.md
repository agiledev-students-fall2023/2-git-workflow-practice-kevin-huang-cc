### Article: [DEATH BY A THOUSAND MICROSERVICES](https://renegadeotter.com/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter)

The author of this articles talks about his opinions on microservices. I find it very interesting because during lecture we talked about the differences between Monolithic architecture and Microservices architecture and concluded that Microservices arthicecture is a growing trend. This article highlights the importance of simplicity and questions the need for microservices in all situations. In reality, every developer has to be "on top of everything, all the time" to keep up with all the changes for it to work.


### Comment: 

This article provides several interesting examples to show that a complex system is not neccesary in many situations. For a simple problem, a simple solution is better. Justin Zhang
